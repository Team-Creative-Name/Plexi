Plexi is a (fairly) easy to use discord bot that aims to allow users to search and request media via discord instead of a web browser.

## Features:

  - Searching Ombi for Television shows and Movies
    - results presented in an easy to use page-based menu system  
  - Adding tv shows and movies to ombi's request list
  - Getting information about media via ID


#### You can also:
  - Request TV shows even if some episodes are already added
  - Get a list of missing TV episodes
  - Get the ping time of all APIs that Plexi uses
